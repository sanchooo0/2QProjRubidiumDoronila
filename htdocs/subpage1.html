        <h3>What is Poverty?</h3>
        <div>As defined by World Vision International, poverty refers to lacking enough resources to provide the necessities of life—food, clean water, shelter, and clothing. But in today’s world, that can be extended to include access to health care, education, and even transportation. In government circles, poverty is often further defined as “absolute poverty” and “relative poverty.” Absolute poverty refers to those whose incomes fall below a line set by a given country. Below this line, people are unable to meet their basic needs for food, water, and shelter. They also have no access to social services such as health care, education, and utilities. Relative poverty refers to people whose total incomes are less than a certain percentage—typically 50%--of the country’s median income. Because the median income can vary as a result of economic growth, the line for relative poverty can change. When poverty is defined to include access to services and security-critical to well-being—and not just income and consumption—the global poverty rate increases by 50%. Every country has its own measure of poverty. However, a widely-recognized authority on the topic of “extreme poverty” is the World Bank. The Bank keeps a metric called the International Poverty Line and, as of 2015, set the definition of extreme poverty as those who live on less than US$1.90 per day. (Those living on between $1.90-$3.10 per day are classified as the “moderate poor.”) This number is based on the monetary value of a person’s consumption rather than income alone.</div>
